# React Native Sample App

Clone the project and run react-native run android

I have created multiple screens which you can access by swiping to the left after initial Load. Most of them use standard libraries like chat/camera.

I have integrated Usplash to fetch photos and display them in the app. 

Clone the Project and modify the code to your need. Thanks
